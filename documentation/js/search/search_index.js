than ever for Harry Potter. The Dursleys of Privet Drive are more horrible to him than ever before. And just when he thinks the endless summer vacation is over, a creature named Dobby the house-elf shows up issuing a grave warning to Harry not to go back to school or disaster will happen! Of course, Harry has to go back- and he does so in grand style, in a flying-car magicked by his friends Ron and Percy Weasley. But getting back to Hogwarts isn't the cure Harry expects it to be. Almost immediately a student is found turned to stone, and then another. And somehow Harry stands accused. Could Harry Potter be the long-feared heir of Slytherin?Harry and friends Hermione and Fred are stretched to their limits in a desperate fight against Draco Malfoy and his gang, the hideously stuck-up new professor Gilderoy Lockheart, the malevolent owner of the diary of Tom Riddle, giant spiders, and perhaps even...Hagrid!This is the book that proves J.K.

The Dursleys of Privet Drive are more horrible to him than ever before. And just when he thinks the endless summer vacation is over, a creature named Dobby the house-elf shows up issuing a grave warning to Harry not to go back to school or disaster will happen! Of course, Harry has to go back- and he does so in grand style, in a flying-car magicked by his friends Ron and Percy Weasley. But getting back to Hogwarts isn\\'t the cure Harry expects it to be. Almost immediately a student is found turned to stone, and then another. And somehow Harry stands accused. Could Harry Potter be the long-feared heir of Slytherin?Harry and friends Hermione and Fred are stretched to their limits in a desperate fight against Draco Malfoy and his gang, the hideously stuck-up new professor Gilderoy Lockheart, the malevolent owner of the diary of Tom Riddle, giant spiders, and perhaps even...Hagrid!This is the book that proves J.K. Rowling is a talent that\\'s here to stay!

server\nTo start a local development server, run:\nExample :ng serveOnce the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nAngular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:\nExample :ng generate component component-nameFor a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), run:\nExample :ng generate --helpBuilding\nTo build the project run:\nExample :ng buildThis will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.\nRunning unit tests\nTo execute unit tests with the Karma test runner, use the following command:\nExample :ng testRunning end-to-end tests\nFor end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:\nExample :ng e2eAngular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.\nAdditional Resources\nFor more information on using the Angular CLI, including detailed command references, visit the Angular CLI Overview and Command
